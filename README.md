An unofficial JavaScript driver for the [Nookipedia API](https://api.nookipedia.com/).

## Installation

It's not published yet. Sorry.

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room...

...why on Earth am I using _svelte_ to build an API driver?

Svelte has a pretty nice `package` sub-command which is pretty good for building an NPM package.
I'm just sticking to what I know, no bundlers or any of that nonsense.
